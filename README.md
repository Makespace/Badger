Software for the makespace badge printing mahine

you'll need...

sudo apt-get install python-tk python-wand

On the aspire one, we found that gnome-screensaver doesn't correctly reactivate the screen, so we removed it and used xscreensaver instead (you can google how to do that, if you need to.)

Contact kim@spencejones.com if you have any questions of suggestions.
